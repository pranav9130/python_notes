!!Before i begin
!!things to keep in mind
!!python do not have switch case construct but there are work arounds mentioned in below document
!!good read about absence of switch case construct in python https://www.pydanny.com/why-doesnt-python-have-switch-case.html


1. if constucts :

  expr : [(] expression_body [)] #eg ( 2 + 3 == 5 )
  actual syntax  : if  expr:
                    **body of if**
                   [elif expr : 
                      **body** ]*
                   [else : 
                      **body** ]?
                      
                      #here  ? : zero or one time
                            * : zero or more times
                            
  Things to keep in mind :
  
  instead of conventional way of using  curly braces to create scopes, python does it by colon symbol ':' and appropriate indentation (tabs generally)
