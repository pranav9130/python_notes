Is Python a dying language? A friend of my grandmotherâ€™s is a computer scientist from MIT. He told me that I should not learn Python because i...

!!spaces are preffered for indentation

Python uses indentation created using spaces or tabs to define scope of the construct/lines grouped together
as mentioned one can use space or tab to provide this indentation

but following things should be kept in mind

1. keep indentation of scope consistent :
     all the lines within scope / construct should be indented in same way. Indentation can be combination of spaces and tabs, but this 
     combination should be consistent across the scope definition
     otherwise one may encounter following error 'TabError: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation'
                                                  'IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level'
     note : the indentation combination may only use space /tabs for indentation.
     !! just keep in mind keep your indentation consistent within the scope !!
     !!but indentation combination may differ across the multiple scopes !!
     
eg :
program : 

value  = 1

if value :                                  #this scopeis incorrect
  print(value, " baitch!!") # tab
    print('outsid if') # 4 spaces 
else :                                        #this scope is correct
	  print('nope') # tab + 2 spaces  
	  print('npoe') # tab + 2 spaces 
output : 
C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3>python tobedeleted/test.py
  File "tobedeleted/test.py", line 6
    print('outsid if')
                     ^
TabError: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation
end EG

eg : 

value  = 1

if value : #correct scope
  	print(value, " baitch!!") #one tab + two spaces 
  	print('outsid if') #one tab + two spaces 
else : #correct scope
	  print('nope')  #four spaces
	  print('npoe')  #four spaces

program output: 
C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3>python tobedeleted/test.py
1  baitch!!
outsid if

**********************
2.  spaces are preffered method of indentation 
3. indentation combination should be consistent within scope but combination may differ across multiple scopes.
